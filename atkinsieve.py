# Sieve of Atkin
#
#
#
# 1. Create a results list, filled with 2, 3, and 5.
# 2. Create a sieve list with an entry for each positive integer; all entries
#    of this list should initially be marked non prime.
# 3. For each entry number n in the sieve list, with modulo-sixty remainder r:
#       (a) If r is 1, 13, 17, 29, 37, 41, 49, or 53, flip the entry for each
#           possible solution to 4(x^2) + y^2 = n.
#       (b) If r is 7, 19, 31, or 43, flip the entry for each possible solution
#           to 3(x^2) + y^2 = n.
#       (c) If r is 11, 23, 47, or 59, flip the entry for each possible
#           solution to 3(x^2) â€“ y^2 = n when x > y.
#       (d) If r is something else, ignore it completely.
# 4. Start with the lowest number in the sieve list.
# 5. Take the next number in the sieve list still marked prime.
# 6. Include the number in the results list.
# 7. Square the number and mark all multiples of that square as non prime. Note
#    that the multiples that can be factored by 2, 3, or 5 need not be marked,
#    as these will be ignored in the final enumeration of primes.
# 8. Repeat steps four through seven.
